# P_Project_EL WIP/TBC
Overview
Simple Innovative Technology Device &amp; AI To Predict The Future.
What this project opens up as a possibility, is truly staggering.
Imagine Being able to make accurate predictions of any future event any temporal distance. 
The project explores the possibility of making predictions across various domains including financial markets, lotteries, and real-time events like roulette spins.WIP/TBC


Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to challenge the conventional understanding of time and events. It explores the idea that everything may already be determined, and our perception merely observes the unfolding of pre-existing events, akin to a needle tracing a record.

Impossible it would seem, but what if the real truth is everything is written.

Could this be a possibility?, Akashic Records, Remote Viewing, NDE's all show a glimmer, the glimmer leads to attention, attention is ALL?.

Description of this public part, this part of the project attempts to predict future UK lotteries using data generated before the event.

The data will be added days before the event, WIP/TBC


Current Progress:
It is time to seek attention to this project to potentionly verify this is a real effect/pheonomina.

This Project Was Demonstrated Live On X.com (prev Twitter) 2023 Nov to Dec 2023.
Published Prediction between 24hours to 1 week prio to Lottery.
Live Demo started from about Index 30, you will see in the data when each dataset was generated.

The data is then stored into target date directory with the gen time as timestamp.
All UK Lottery Results Take Place After ðŸ•¢ 19:30 H:M On Days SAT/WED

The great thing about this project is it is real and you can run it on you system to verify before the event happens therefore impossible to cheat.
I am hoping to generate a buzz around this as the implications are uncomprehendable.

Its not at the undenial level of accuracy yet, The models here are from models designed in 2023.
