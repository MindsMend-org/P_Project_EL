Overview
Simple Innovative Technology Device &amp; AI To Predict The Future.
What this project opens up as a possibility, is truly staggering.
Imagine Being able to make accurate predictions of any future event any temporal distance. 
The project explores the possibility of making predictions across various domains including financial markets, lotteries, and real-time events like roulette spins.WIP/TBC


Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to challenge the conventional understanding of time and events. It explores the idea that everything may already be determined, and our perception merely observes the unfolding of pre-existing events, akin to a needle tracing a record.

Impossible it would seem, but what if the real truth is everything is written.

Could this be a possibility?, Akashic Records, Remote Viewing, NDE's all show a glimmer, the glimmer leads to attention, attention is ALL?.

Description of this public part, this part of the project attempts to predict future UK lotteries using data generated before the event.

The data will be added days before the event, WIP/TBC
