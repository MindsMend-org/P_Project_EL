# P_Project_EL (WIP/TBC)

## Overview
**Simple Innovative Technology Device & AI To Predict The Future.**

What this project opens up as a possibility, is truly staggering. Imagine being able to make accurate predictions of any future event at any temporal distance. The project explores the possibility of making predictions across various domains, including financial markets, lotteries, and real-time events like roulette spins. (WIP/TBC)

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to challenge the conventional understanding of time and events. It explores the idea that everything may already be determined, and our perception merely observes the unfolding of pre-existing events, akin to a needle tracing a record.

Impossible it would seem, but what if the real truth is everything is written? Could this be a possibility? Akashic Records, Remote Viewing, NDEs all show a glimmer. The glimmer leads to attention, and attention is ALL.

## Description
This part of the project attempts to predict future UK lotteries using data generated before the event. The data will be added days before the event. (WIP/TBC)

## Current Progress
It is time to seek attention to this project to potentially verify this is a real effect/phenomenon.

- **Live Demonstration**: This project was demonstrated live on X.com (previously Twitter) from November to December 2023.
- **Published Predictions**: Predictions were published between 24 hours to 1 week prior to the lottery draw.
- **Data Storage**: Data is stored in the target date directory with the generation time as the timestamp.
- **UK Lottery Results**: All UK Lottery results take place after 19:30 (H:M) on SAT/WED.

The great thing about this project is it is real and you can run it on your system to verify before the event happens, making it impossible to cheat. I am hoping to generate a buzz around this as the implications are incomprehensible.
