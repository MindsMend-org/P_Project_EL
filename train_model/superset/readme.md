# Superset 2023 ver

## Do we live in a determined simulation?

This whole system and especially this dataset creation idea was constructed on the belief that it very well could be. The idea of time unfolding and compressing/shifting gives it its accuracy.

We think in terms of signal and noise. I say, what's the difference? And can we use the difference? If correct, a fully trained model will always predict well, much better than these baby models, as noise is part of the illusion as much as the signal.

## python superset.py

## Currently written to generate 50k mini datasets created on the fly

- Fully synthetic datasets
- Representing a temporal holographic wave
- Balanced as best can be

## Soon moving to use the generated files from the C++ superset combination generator
- superset.py will check for valid_combinations*.txt files to use to generate a block, that block is designed by the numbers and patterns contained in each .txt file.
- superset.py wil generate a synthetic block [1 block per .txt file]

### Execution

```python
python superset.py
